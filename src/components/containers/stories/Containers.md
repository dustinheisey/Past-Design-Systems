# Container Usage Examples

Center - Use to horizontally center something

Cluster - suit any groups of elements that differ in length and are liable to wrap. Buttons that appear together at the end of forms are ideal candidates, as well as lists of tags, keywords, or other meta information. Use the Cluster to align any groups of horizontally laid out elements to the left or right, or in the center.

Cover - A typical use for the Cover would be to create the “above the fold” introductory content for a web page.

Frame - The Frame is mostly useful for cropping media (videos and images) to a desired aspect ratio. Once you start controlling the aspect ratio, you can of course tailor it to the current circumstances. For example, you might want to give images a different aspect ratio depending on the viewport orientation.

Grid - Grids are great for browsing teasers for permalinks or products. I can quickly compose a card component to house each of my teasers using a Box and a Stack.

Imposter - Wherever content needs to be deliberately obscured, the Imposter pattern is your friend. It may be that the content is yet to be made available. In which case, the Imposter may consist of a call-to-action to unlock that content.

Masonry - blog layout, editorial, display list of content

Reel - The Reel is a robust and efficient antidote to carousel/slider components. As already discussed and demonstrated, it is ideal for browsing categories of things: movies; products; news stories; photographs.

In addition, it can be used to supplant button-activated menu systems. What Bradley Taunt calls sausage links may well be more usable than “hamburger” menus for many. For such a use case, the visible scrollbar is probably rather heavy-handed. This is why the ensuing custom element implementation includes a Boolean noBar property.

Sidebar - The ubiquitous “media object” (the placing of an item of media next to a description) is a mainstay, but it can also be used to align buttons with form inputs (where the button forms the sidebar and has an intrinsic, content-based width).

Stack - The potential remit of the Stack layout can hardly be overestimated. Anywhere elements are stacked one atop another, it is likely a Stack should be in effect.

Switcher - When you want to switch directly between a horizontal and vertical layout. It is especially useful where each element should be considered equal, or part of a continuum. Card components advertising products should share the same width no matter the orientation, otherwise one or more cards could be perceived as highlighted or featured in some way. A set of numbered steps is also easier on cognition if those steps are laid out along one horizontal or vertical line.
