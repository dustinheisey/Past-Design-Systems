## Reel Layout

The Reel is a robust and efficient antidote to carousel/slider components. As already discussed and demonstrated, it is ideal for browsing categories of things: movies; products; news stories; photographs.

In addition, it can be used to supplant button-activated menu systems. What Bradley Taunt calls sausage links may well be more usable than “hamburger” menus for many. For such a use case, the visible scrollbar is probably rather heavy-handed. This is why the ensuing custom element implementation includes a Boolean noBar property.

/>

<div class="center">
    <button>Centered Button</button>
</div>
