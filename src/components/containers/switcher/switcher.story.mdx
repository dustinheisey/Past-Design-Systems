## Switcher Layout

When you want to switch directly between a horizontal and vertical layout. It is especially useful where each element should be considered equal, or part of a continuum. Card components advertising products should share the same width no matter the orientation, otherwise one or more cards could be perceived as highlighted or featured in some way. A set of numbered steps is also easier on cognition if those steps are laid out along one horizontal or vertical line.
