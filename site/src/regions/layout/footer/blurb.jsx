    <p>
      Our house is on fire — let’s act like it. We demand climate justice for
      everyone. The youth are striking all across Oregon, and they want you to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week is our chance to show the politicians and fossil fuel
      billionaires that real power lies with the people. This week is your
      chance to join the climate justice movement, and put a stop to business as
      usual.
    </p>
    <em>We are nonviolent, peaceful, and family-friendly.</em>
